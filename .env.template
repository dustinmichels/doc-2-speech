# Python backend environment variables
# Copy this file to .env and fill in values as needed.
# Note: the npm scripts in app/package.json set these inline, so a .env file
# is only needed if you run the Python backend directly.

# Override the Ollama model used for text refinement.
# If unset, the backend auto-detects the first installed model from its known-models list.
# Set to a fake name to confirm the override path without a real model pull.
# Example: LLM_MODEL=llama3.2:3b
LLM_MODEL=
